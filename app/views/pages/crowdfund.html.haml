        %p.lead The Plan
        %p
          Early next year we’re launching the first crowd owned, blockchain
          controlled fleet of repurposed sailing vessels to sail around the
          globe on 100% renewable energy.
        %p
          Entropy is a global experiment for digital decision making and
          cooperativsm that is now made possible with Ethereum.
          We will refine the workings of the Entropy DAO as we test it,
          resulting in a DAO template that is useful for anyone that wants to
          base their DAO on the same values of equality and fair distribution of power.
          All while the crew logs what is happening in videos, posts and pictures!
        %p
          Have a look below at the outline of our crowdfund and the goals that we want to achieve.
